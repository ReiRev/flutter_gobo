# gobo

Want to see it in action? Check out the [interactive demo](https://reirev.github.io/flutter_gobo/) powered by Widgetbook! You can find the Widgetbook implementation code [here](https://github.com/ReiRev/flutter_gobo/tree/main/widgetbook).

Gobo is a straightforward Flutter package designed for creating Go boards. It leverages [Flame](https://github.com/flame-engine/flame) game engine, for efficient rendering.

Please note that Go rules and game logic are not included in Gobo. For those looking for a Dart-based Go rules engine, consider using our another package, [golo](https://github.com/ReiRev/dart_golo).

## Installation

```bash
flutter pub add gobo
```

## Note

This package is still in active development. We welcome any feedback or suggestions to help us improve Gobo. Feel free to open an issue to discuss.
